But luckily, this was the stage where my experience as a graphic designer proved to be useful. Throughout the design process, I kept the festival-goers in mind and aimed to create a user-friendly interface that would enhance their browsing experience. To achieve this, I incorporated intuitive navigation, clear call-to-actions, and mobile responsiveness. Overall, I am proud of the final UI design proposal for the Shockwave Music Festival website, and I believe it meets the requirements and goals set for this project. Working on Shockwave has allowed me to grow as a designer and gain valuable experience in working with challenging color palettes while maintaining a user-centered approach."
