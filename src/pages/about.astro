          <p>
            My journey started in 2017 with my first lecture on graphic design
            at a Slovak high school, continued through my studies of Design,
            Technology, and Business at UCN. During this time, I also worked as
            a graphic designer for a printing house, which was a priceless
            opportunity, that allowed me to put my fresh theoretical knowledge
            under the test in the real life. Despite my deep passion for printed
            media, these valuable experiences in the graphic design field led me
            to realization that my true passion lies within UI design

          reverse={true}
        >
          <p>
            My education and experience as a graphic designer have provided me a
            solid foundation, especially in color theory, fonts, visual
            hierarchy, composition, and layouts. In the past few months, I have
            expanded my knowledge of UI rules and principles through online
            courses and by applying theoretical knowledge to personal projects.
            During my free time, you can find me reading a book, baking
            delicious cakes, or trying to beat my personal records at the gym.
