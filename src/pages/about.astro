            My journey started in 2017 with my first lecture about graphic
            design in a Slovak high school. This continued through my studies of
            Design, Technology, and Business at UCN, where I also worked as a
            graphic designer for a printing house. These valuable experiences in
            the graphic design field led me to the realization that my true
            passion lies within UI design.
