    <h2>Project overview</h2>
    <p>
      Shockwave is a design concept for pop and rock music festival. The main
      challenge was to design a website that captures the spirit and energy of
      the festival while providing users with easy navigation and access to the
      necessary information.

    <h3>Goals and objectives</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc">
      <li>Make design responsive for various devices</li>
      <li>
        To create an user- friendly and visually appealing user interface for a
        festival website that showcases the event schedule, performers, and
        ticket information.

        User research is a critical component of UI design, which helped me gain
        insights into the target audience's behaviours, goals, and pain points.
        By understanding how users interact with a product or service, designers
        can create user-centered designs that meet the needs and expectations of
        the users. For this UI design case study, I conducted user research
        ensure that the final product would be effective and engaging. Variety
        of research methods was used to to gather data on our target audience's
        demographics and preferences

      <h3>Scoping out the competition</h3>
      <p>
        In order to create a successful UI design for a Shockwave website, it's
        important to take a look at what other festivals are doing. By
        conducting a thorough competitor analysis, I could identify industry
        trends, best practices, and areas for improvement. In this section, I'll
        examine the websites of three competing music festivals and evaluate
        their strengths and weaknesses in terms of design, user experience, and
        functionality.

        In the process of designing website is also important to understand the
        needs and behaviours of the target audience. To achieve this, I have
        created user personas that represent the different types of users that
        our product aims to serve. By using these personas as a reference, I can
        ensure that design decisions are informed by user insights and aligned
        with their goals and expectations. So let’s meet sample users John, Lisa
        and Alex.

        The task flows for a user who is familiar with the Shockwave festival
        website and a user who is visiting the website for the first time are
        different because a familiar user already knows the layout and features
        of the website, while an unfamiliar user is learning about the website
        for the first time. The familiar user skips the "About" page and goes
        straight to the "Top artists" section on the homepage, because they
        already know what the festival is about and do not need to learn more.
        In contrast, the unfamiliar user starts by visiting the "About" page to
        learn more about the festival before exploring the lineup and purchasing
        tickets.

              After reading about the festival's history, mission, values, and

              Alex then moves to the "Artists" page to view the festival's

        The prototyping phase of UI design process involved creating a
        wireframes together with low and high-fidelity interactive prototype of
        the Shockwave website. I aimed to create a prototype that accurately
        reflected the final product and allowed to test user interactions and
        gather feedback before moving on to development. To achieve this, Figma
        was to create a clickable prototype that included all the key features
        and functionality of the website. In the following sections, I will
        discuss the design decisions made during the prototyping phase.

      <h3>A Blueprint for Shockwave</h3>
      <p>
        In the initial stages of designing Shockwave website, wireframe sketches
        were created to establish the basic layout and structure of the site.
        These sketches served as a roadmap for the design process, allowing me
        to quickly iterate on different design ideas. By visualising the site's
        layout and structure in wireframes, we were able to identify potential
        issues early on and make necessary changes before moving on to
        high-fidelity designs.

        In order to validate design decisions and test the usability of proposed
        solutions, I created a series of low-fidelity prototypes for the music

        iterate on ideas and gather feedback from users before committing to a
        more polished design.

      <h3>Navigating the festival experience</h3>

        The task flow section of our music festival website was designed with
        users in mind. I understand that festival-goers want to quickly and
        easily access information about the lineup, schedule, and locations of
        various stages. To meet this need, I created a task flow that allows
        users to navigate the website with ease and efficiency. In this section
        of the case study, I'll explore the steps of two different types of
        user. Lisa - familiar user and Alex - new user. Exploring behaviour of
        users who are on different levels of familiarity with the website is
        crucial for user-centered interface.

        One of the main goals of this project was creating a responsive design
        that adapts seamlessly to a variety of screen sizes and devices. I
        approached this stage of project with idea of a user interface that
        provides an optimal viewing and interaction experience on various
        devices, from smartphones to desktops, in mind. Following is the final
        prototype that I created, showing how I ensured that the design was
        responsive and user-friendly across all devices.
