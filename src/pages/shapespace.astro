      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>
        For this particular UI design case study, I made sure to conduct user
        research to ensure that the final product would be effective and
        engaging. To achieve this, I used a variety of research methods to
        gather data on our target audience's demographics and preferences. This
        allowed me to get a better understanding of the audience's interests,
        behaviors, and preferences when it comes to architecture and design.
      </p>
      <h3>Research goals</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>
          To gain an understanding of the architectural blog culture and what

        <li>To identify the target audience and their preferences</li>
        <li>

      <header><h2>Competitor analysis</h2></header>
      <h3>Breaking ground</h3>
      <p>
        To conduct a competitor analysis for an architectural blog, it's
        important to identify the key players in the industry. Some popular
        architectural blogs include Dezeen, and Ignant. An evaluation of each
        competitor's strengths and weaknesses should be conducted, including the
        design and layout of the website, the quality and originality of the
        content, the engagement options available to users, and the overall user
        experience. By understanding what makes these competitors successful, an
        architectural blog can identify areas where they can improve and
        differentiate themselves from the competition. It's also important to
        consider the target audience and what they are looking for in an
        architectural blog. By understanding the competition and the target
        audience, an architectural blog can create a unique and compelling user
        experience that sets them apart from the competition.

          <p class="font-bold">Strengths</p>

          <li>
            Visual Appeal: One of the biggest strengths of the IGNANT website is
            its visually appealing design. The website features stunning
            high-quality images that are both captivating and engaging. The

          <li>
            Lack of Original Content: While IGNANT covers a wide range of
            topics, much of the content is sourced from other websites. This can
            make the website feel less original and may turn off users who are
            looking for fresh, unique content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Limited Engagement: While the website is visually appealing, it
            doesn't offer much in terms of user engagement. There are no comment
            sections or forums where users can interact with each other, which
            may limit the website's appeal to some users.

      <h3>Nice to meet you, I am your user</h3>
      <p>
        In the context of architectural blog website UI design, it is essential
        to understand the needs and behaviors of the target audience, which
        often includes architects, architecture students, and design
        professionals. By creating user personas that represent these different
        types of users, designers can gain valuable insights into their goals,
        preferences, and pain points. For example, architects like David may be
        looking for new design concepts and ideas, while architecture students
        like Sarah may be seeking learning resources to improve their design
        skills. Design professionals like Maria may be looking for in-depth
        information and analysis to inspire their projects. By understanding the
        needs and behaviors of these users, designers can create a user-centered
        design that effectively meets their needs and expectations.

      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>
        As part of the architectural blog website UI design project, the
        prototyping phase involved amongst other processes, creating wireframes
        and low and high-fidelity interactive prototypes of the website. The
        primary objective was to create a prototype that accurately reflected
        the final product and allowed testing of user interactions and gathering
        feedback before finalisation. To achieve this, I used Figma to create a
        clickable prototype that included all the key features and functionality
        of the website. By creating these prototypes, I was able to ensure that
        the final product met the needs and expectations of the target audience,
        which included architects, architecture students, and design
        professionals. The prototypes were crucial in refining the design and
        improving user experience before moving on to the final stage.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototyping goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
