      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>
        For this particular UI design case study, I made sure to conduct user
        research to ensure that the final product would be effective and
        engaging. To achieve this, I used a variety of research methods to
        gather data on our target audience's demographics and preferences. This
        allowed me to get a better understanding of the audience's interests,
        behaviors, and preferences when it comes to architecture and design.

      <h3>Research goals</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>
          To gain an understanding of the architectural blog culture and what

      <header><h2>Competitor analysis</h2></header>
      <h3>Breaking ground</h3>
      <p>
        To conduct a competitor analysis for an architectural blog, it's
        important to identify the key players in the industry. Some popular
        architectural blogs include Dezeen, and Ignant. An evaluation of each
        competitor's strengths and weaknesses should be conducted, including the
        design and layout of the website, the quality and originality of the
        content, the engagement options available to users, and the overall user
        experience. By understanding what makes these competitors successful, an
        architectural blog can identify areas where they can improve and
        differentiate themselves from the competition. It's also important to
        consider the target audience and what they are looking for in an
        architectural blog. By understanding the competition and the target
        audience, an architectural blog can create a unique and compelling user
        experience that sets them apart from the competition.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="font-bold">Weaknesses</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Limited use of visual aids:</b> While Designboom's website does feature
          some visual aids such as images and videos, it could benefit from the use
          of more icons, infographics, and other visual aids to help break up large
          blocks of text and make information easier to understand.
        </li>

        <li>

          to read if the colors are not sufficiently contrasting.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b> Limited use of animation:</b> While Designboom's website does feature
          some animations and interactive elements, it could benefit from the use

          This is important because it makes the content easier to read and navigate,
          and can help to reduce user fatigue. Additionally, the use of white space
          can draw attention to important elements on the page and make them stand
          out.

        <li>
          <b> Inconsistent use of color and hierarchy:</b> Ignant's website has a
          visually appealing color scheme, the colors are not always used consistently
          throughout the website. This can make it more difficult for users to understand
          the website's hierarchy and navigate to important pages or actions.

      <h3>Nice to meet you, I am your user</h3>
      <p>
        In the context of architectural blog website UI design, it is essential
        to understand the needs and behaviors of the target audience, which
        often includes architects, architecture students, and design
        professionals. By creating user personas that represent these different
        types of users, designers can gain valuable insights into their goals,
        preferences, and pain points. For example, architects like David may be
        looking for new design concepts and ideas, while architecture students
        like Sarah may be seeking learning resources to improve their design
        skills. Design professionals like Maria may be looking for in-depth
        information and analysis to inspire their projects. By understanding the
        needs and behaviors of these users, designers can create a user-centered
        design that effectively meets their needs and expectations.

      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>
        As part of the architectural blog website UI design project, the
        prototyping phase involved amongst other processes, creating wireframes
        and low and high-fidelity interactive prototypes of the website. The
        primary objective was to create a prototype that accurately reflected
        the final product and allowed testing of user interactions and gathering
        feedback before finalisation. To achieve this, I used Figma to create a
        clickable prototype that included all the key features and functionality
        of the website. By creating these prototypes, I was able to ensure that
        the final product met the needs and expectations of the target audience,
        which included architects, architecture students, and design
        professionals. The prototypes were crucial in refining the design and
        improving user experience before moving on to the final stage.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototyping goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
