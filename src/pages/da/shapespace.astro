      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>
        As part of the architectural blog website UI design project, the
        prototyping phase involved amongst other processes, creating wireframes
        and low and high-fidelity interactive prototypes of the website. The
        primary objective was to create a prototype that accurately reflected
        the final product and allowed testing of user interactions and gathering
        feedback before finalisation. To achieve this, I used Figma to create a
        clickable prototype that included all the key features and functionality
        of the website. By creating these prototypes, I was able to ensure that
        the final product met the needs and expectations of the target audience,
        which included architects, architecture students, and design
        professionals. The prototypes were crucial in refining the design and
        improving user experience before moving on to the final stage.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototyping goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To create a testable prototype that allows for user feedback and
          iteration
        </li>
        <li>
          To simulate user interactions and identify potential usability issues
        </li>
        <li>
          To refine and iterate on design solutions based on user feedback and
          testing
        </li>
        <li>
          To ensure that the final product meets user needs and expectations
          through user testing and feedback
        </li>
      </ul>
